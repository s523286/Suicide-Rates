# Analysis
- Present	the	analyses	that	you	performed	on	the	data.	
- Talk about the models you used and how you tuned them.		
- Talk	about	what	worked	and	what	did	not	work	and	link	to	the	notebooks	where	you	did	the	analysis.		
  - linear regression did not work because the data is not linear. I could not get an R-squared above .5 and that means y only explains less than 50% of the variation in x. That is not great.
  - A decision tree did work. We got very high scores for accuracy, F1, precision and sensitivity.
- What	challenges	did	you	face	and	how	did	you	overcome	them.	
- Give	any	limitations	on	the	results	you	are	presenting here.		
- Talk	about	improvements	that	could	be	made.
