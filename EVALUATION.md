#  Evaluation


## Milestone 2 (40/40 pts)

1. Create Notebook classification
* Data section (5)
* Markdown on feature choice and explanation (5)
* Decision tree (5)
* Metrics computed (5)
* Markdown commments (2/5)
* Try another classifier (5)
* Evaluation on test set (5)
* Markdown discussion of the results (5)
2. Updated the README

You need graphs to help present the results.

Good use of other models.

I prefer to have the discussion of the work directly documented in the notebooks and then put higher level analysis in the README (and eventually in other high level documents.)
